tutsplus-Downloader
===================
This is an Automator workflow to download the videos of tutsplus courses for members who already has access for downloading. This workflow just enables you to sit back and relax while Safari downloads the videos for you.
## How Does it Work?
You just open the course you want to download and set that tab as the first tab of your active Safari window. When you run the workflow, it will download the files one by one with a delay between that you can set. Then it will check if the course has source files and download that too if there are any.
## But Why?
If you want a course to be ready while you are doing something else and not get distracted this might be what you need. Because sometimes you need another course ready while watching one or you want a couple courses downloaded while you are asleep. Well, you can just copy paste the script one after another, change the tab numbers and open the courses you want downloaded, then you are good to go.
